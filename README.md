# DMDK
Deep Model Deployment Kit
----

This is DMDK, intending to be an easy & fast deployment framework for deep models, built upon numpy & cython.

DMDK is mainly designed for deploying models trained via Lasagne and Pytorch. To minimise the model redefinition work under a new framework, the interface API of DMDK is consistent with Lasagne as close as possible, and do the inference workflow quite similar as Pytorch.

DMDK is now in a very early dev. stage.
